# Type @ Cooper

## Introduction

Welcome to our weekend of Python programming!

The goal for the weekend is to get you well set in being able to use Python as part of your design process. This will serve as a collection of links, resources, and the code for the weekend for your continued reference and use.

## Resources

### Python

Their are several great sources for online tutorials on Python (and Googling your problem + Python usually turns up the answer on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com)). Here is a starting point:

* [Official Python Documentation](https://www.python.org/doc/)
* [Learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org)
* [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python)
* [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/)
* [Python 2 to 3](http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html)
* [Part of Just van Rossum’s talk at Robothon18](https://youtu.be/3IZ1rm5FrFQ?t=7660)

### Drawbot

We’ll start out learning Python inside of [Drawbot](http://www.drawbot.com). The Drawbot website has a lot of really useful tutorials and documentation (and you can click on the code on the site and have it run in Drawbot!). Be sure to have a look at:

* [Download Drawbot](http://www.drawbot.com/content/download.html)
* [Quick reference](http://www.drawbot.com/content/quickReference.html)
* [Python basics courseware](http://www.drawbot.com/content/courseware.html)
* [Forum](http://forum.drawbot.com)

Some folks doing fun things with Drawbot:

* Drawbot is on [twitter](https://twitter.com/drawbotapp)
* [Daily Drawbot](http://dailydrawbot.tumblr.com)
* Maurice Meilleur, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MauriceMeilleur) & [Personal site](http://mauricemeilleur.net/motion/)


### RoboFont

We’ll be exploring both the now defunct [RoboFab](http://robofab.com) and the new [FontParts](https://github.com/robofab-developers/fontParts) in RoboFont. Documenation is:

* [RoboDocs](http://www.robodocs.info)(a central source for documentation for many type coding libraries)
* [RoboFab Docs](http://www.robodocs.info/roboFabDocs/source/index.html)
* [FontParts Docs](http://fontparts.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
